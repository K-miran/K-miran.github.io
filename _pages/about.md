## About me
I am an assistant professor of [School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI)](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/miran-kim.htm) at the University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston, where I have worked since May of 2018. From 2017-2018, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Division of Biomedical Informatics of University of California San Diego (hosted by Prof. [Xiaoqian Jiang](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/xiaoqian-jiang.htm)). I received my Ph.D. degree in mathematical sciences at Seoul National University, Korea in 2017 (advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)).

## Research Interest
I am working in the field of secure computation, which aims to develop advanced cryptographic primitives to protect sensitive data of individuals while providing the same service to the customers. I have an extensive experience in implementation of secure and privacy-preserving protocols for cyber-physical systems, data query processing, and genomic computation. In particular, I received multiple first prizes on secure outsourcing genome analysis of [iDASH Genome Privacy and Security Competition](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/) (supported by National Institutes of Health), which report state-of-the-art performance of cryptographic schemes in real-world biomedical problems. As a noteworthy service to the scientific community, I serve as the organizer of the iDASH privacy competition since 2019.

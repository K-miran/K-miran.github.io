## About me
I am an assistant professor of [School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI)](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/miran-kim.htm) at the University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston, where I have worked since May of 2018. From 2017-2018, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Division of Biomedical Informatics of University of California San Diego (hosted by Prof. [Xiaoqian Jiang](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/xiaoqian-jiang.htm)). I received my Ph.D. degree in mathematical sciences at Seoul National University, Korea in 2017 (advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)).

## Research Interest
My research focuses on the design of novel strategies to enable secure and privacy-preserving data analysis. I have an extensive experience in implementation of efficient protocols for data query processing, genomic computation, and cyber-physical systems. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, I received the first prizes on secure outsourcing tasks of genome data privacy challenges at iDASH Genome Privacy & Security competition (supported by National Institutes of Health). Since 2019, I have served as the organizer of the iDASH Competition.

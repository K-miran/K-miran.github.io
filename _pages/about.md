## About me
I joined the [School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI)](https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/miran-kim.htm) at the University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston on May 1, 2018 as an assistant professor. Before arriving at SBMI, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Division of Biomedical Informatics of University of California San Diego. During my postdoctoral training, I worked on privacy preserving biomedical data analysis under Dr. Jiangâ€™s supervision. I received my Ph.D. degree in mathematical sciences at Seoul National University, Korea, in 2017 (advised by [Dr. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/)).

## Research Interest
My research focuses on the design of novel strategies to enable secure and privacy-preserving data analysis. I have an extensive experience in implementation of efficient protocols for data query processing, genomic computation, and cyber-physical systems. In 2015, 2017, and 2018, I received the first prizes on secure outsourcing tasks of genome data privacy challenges at iDASH Genome Privacy & Security competition (supported by National Institutes of Health).
